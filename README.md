First repository being created on this account

Hello! This is my first repository being created on my account. I like to paint and read over winter, and I enjoy writing code in HTML and CSS (mainly because they are a bit easier!). I also like hot chocolate. 

Hello SugarLabs- I am creating a new branch to practice using GitHub.
